      <p>I love making things and even love to make things better more. I've been creating websites for 5+ years through online website creators. Ever since I made my first website, I ventured into editing the styling and have done so here and there ever since. Now I make my websites from scratch and have been doing so for 1.5 years. I've made websites mainly for gaming networks, E-Commerce and more. My specialty is to take a vision and make it into reality through HTML & CSS. My interests, however, extend beyond the web and I thoroughly enjoy all aspects of business. When I'm not developing I am hanging out with friends, enjoying the outdoors, playing video games or working out.</p>
